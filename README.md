# Floating UI

Floating UI is a JavaScript library to position "floating" elements â€” those
which pop out from the flow of the document and are overlaid on top the UI,
positioned next to a reference element.

Examples of floating elements include tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, menus, and
more.

Floating UI is platform-agnostic, so it supports any platform which provides the
necessary `Platform` API to measure elements in layout. The web and React (DOM
and Native) are currently supported officially, but a wrapper for any framework
can be made.
