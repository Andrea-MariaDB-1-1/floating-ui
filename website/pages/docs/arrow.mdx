# arrow

The `arrow` modifier provides data to position an inner element
of the floating element, usually the triangle or caret which
points toward the reference element, so that it is centered to
it.

## Usage

```js
import {computePosition, arrow} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  modifiers: [arrow({element: arrowElement})],
});
```

```html
<div id="tooltip">
  Tooltip text
  <div id="arrow"></div>
</div>
```

## Options

`arrow` accepts an object of options.

### element

Type: `HTMLElement`

This is the arrow element to be positioned.

```js
arrow({
  element: document.querySelector('#arrow'),
});
```

### padding

Type: `number | SideObject`

This describes the padding between the arrow and the edges of the
floating element. If your floating element has `border-radius`,
this will prevent it from overflowing the corners.

```js
arrow({
  element: document.querySelector('#arrow'),
  padding: 5, // stop 5px from the edges of the floating element
});
```

## Data

The following data is available in `modifiersData.arrow`:

```ts
type Data = {
  x?: number;
  y?: number;
  centerOffset: number;
};
```

### x

This property exists if the arrow should be offset on the x-axis.

### y

This property exists if the arrow should be offset on the y-axis.

### centerOffset

This property describes where the arrow actually is relative to
where it could be if it were allowed to overflow the floating
element in order to stay centered to the reference element.

This enables two useful things:

- You can hide the arrow if it can't stay centered to the
  reference, i.e. `centerOffset !== 0`.
- You can interpolate the shape of the arrow (e.g. skew it) so it
  stays centered as best as possible.
