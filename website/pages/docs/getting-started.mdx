# Getting Started

Floating UI is a lean low-level library that positions all types
of elements which float on the page (overlaid on top of the UI)
next to a given reference element: tooltips, popovers, dropdowns,
menus, and more.

It's platform-agnostic, so it works anywhere that JavaScript
runs, including the web and [React Native](/docs/react-native)!

To use on the web, install `@floating-ui/dom` via npm or Yarn in
your terminal:

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

```shell
yarn add @floating-ui/dom
```

## CDN

Floating UI can be used via the `unpkg` CDN by adding `<script>`
tags to your document before your own scripts:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/core@0"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/dom@0"></script>
```

> Important: you should open each link to retrieve the latest
> version to lock it to that version.

All exports will then be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM`.

## Tutorial

Get up and running with a real practical example by creating a
[tooltip](/docs/tutorial).
